# MatLabFinal
This program is for determing the amount of stress being placed on a rod at different points. This is done using MatLab and is best thought of as a rudimnentery finite element analysis. FEA is the process of breaking an object into many small chunks so that stresses, strains, tempertatures, and other mechincal properties can be detrmined for each point in the object. The more chunks the object is broken into, the more accurate the analysis but the longer it will take. The analysis in this case is represnted by 2 seperate graphs, but is generally done with a heatmap of the 3d object.
